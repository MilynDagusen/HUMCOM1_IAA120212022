            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The name Baguio conjures, for both the international and domestic 
                traveler, a highland retreat in the Grand Cordillera in Northern 
                Luzon, with pine trees, crisp cold breezes and low verdant knolls 
                and hillocks. Through the numerous decades Baguio has morphed from 
                what was once a grassy marshland into one of the cleanest and greenest,
                 most highly urbanized cities in the country. It has made its mark as 
                 a premiere tourist destination in the Northern part of the Philippines 
                 with its cool climate, foggy hills, panoramic views and lovely flowers. 
                 Being the ideal convergence zone of neighboring highland places, Baguio is 
                 the melting pot of different peoples and cultures and has boosted its ability 
                 to provide a center for education for its neighbors. Its rich culture and 
                 countless resources have lured numerous investments and business opportunities 
                 to the city.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The arrival of the Americans in the early 1900s spurred development in the City. 
                The American Governor Luke E. Wright commissioned Architect Daniel H. Burnham, 
                a prominent Urban Planner to develop a plan for a health resort where the American 
                soldiers and civilian employees could find respite from the sweltering lowland 
                heat. This plan, better known as the Burnham Plan greatly altered the original 
                mountain settlement and provided the first physical framework plan for the City. 
                It paved the way for rapid physical development, the undertones of which are still 
                visible up this date.

                The physical framework as embodied in the Burnham Plan integrates a road and park 
                system into one. It envisioned evolving in a compact garden city for 25,000 to 
                30,000 people. Supporting this development plan was the enactment of a charter 
                approved on September 1, 1909 that provided administrative as well as managerial 
                autonomy for the city. Soon after the city’s charter was enacted, scenic Kennon 
                Road was opened to vehicular traffic. This triggered the mining boom in surrounding 
                areas in the early to mid 1930’s. Baguio City was the service and operations 
                center for the mining industry, and hence a direct beneficiary of the economic 
                growth. The events of the Second World War stalled all development, leaving the 
                city in total devastation. Fast placed development however ensued following the 
                war years. Such development trends transformed the city into what it is today, a 
                premier urban center north of Manila, performing a municipality of roles, as an 
                educational, trade, tourism and administrative center.</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>Baguio is 8 degrees cooler on the average than any place in lowlands. When Manila 
                sweats at 35 degrees centigrade or above, Baguio seldom exceeds 26 degrees centigrade 
                at its warmest. Baguio is very wet during the Philippine rainy season, which is from June 
                to October. It gets the biggest amount of rainfall in the country, twice the volume of 
                rainfall in the country as compared to Manila. However from November to May, Baguio becomes 
                a tropical paradise, a refreshing break from the hot and humid Philippine climate. Christmas 
                season is when Baguio glows with the nippy winter air. In the summer month of March, April, 
                May, Baguio lives up to its title as the “”Summer Capital of the Philippines when thousands 
                of visitors from the lowlands and Manila take their annual exodus to the city to cool off. 
                Casual clothing is recommended worn with jackets or sweaters in the late afternoons or evenings.</p>

            <h2>Socio-Cultural</h2>
            <p>Ilocano is the predominant dialect in the city. The national language, Filipino, is of course 
                spoken by almost everyone. English is widely spoken and understood. It is the medium of instruction 
                in all public and private schools. Most newspaper and magazines are printed in this language and 
                the English-speaking traveler would not encounter any communication problems. Religiosity is a basic 
                socio-cultural characteristic that makes the Filipino character distinct and unique as manifested 
                likewise by Baguio residents. Over the years, the number of religious sects in the City has been 
                increasing. The three most dominant are Roman Catholics to which 80.4 percent of the population belong, 
                followed by the Episcopalian Church with 5.8 percent and the Iglesia ni Cristo with 3.5 percent membership. 
                The remaining 10.3 percent distributed among other religious sects.</p>

            <h2>Public Services</h2>
            <p>The main thrust of public governance is to maintain functional administrative machinery that will ensure 
                effective and efficient delivery of public services to the constituents.

                In order to achieve operational efficiency, the city is bent in pursuing major development innovations 
                that will enhance more effective service delivery. Administrative capability build-up includes hiring 
                for vital and vacant positions and training of personnel. Support for the Computerization Program 
                continues in this plan to upgrade and make more efficient the operations of the various city government 
                offices with primary focus on departments concerned with real property assessment and taxation and revenue collection.
                
                The continuing executive-legislative cooperation is a salient feature in local management. 
                This fostered teamwork that evolved faster and more effective decision making, particularly on major 
                development issues and budgetary allocations. The government system is manned by a total workforce of 
                1,399 career and elective personnel and operated on a budget of Php 458,800.00 for year 2000.
