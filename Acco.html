            <p>The Manor by Camp John Hay still reigns as the most sought-after accommodation 
                in the city. With the wooden cabin-style lodging and the sea of pine trees 
                covering the property, there’s something truly magical, and for many, 
                nostalgic, about a staycation at The Manor. During the holidays, the accommodation becomes a place 
                of congregation for family and friends to watch the Christmas lights and 
                converse by the fire. More than just an accommodation, you’re guaranteed 
                beautiful memories at The Manor. </p>

            <p>Similar to The Manor, The Forest Lodge doesn’t fall short in terms of 
                comfort and providing a true Baguio experience. The only difference 
                between the two accommodations is the location. If you’re looking for 
                something more quiet and low-key, the Forest Lodge is the right pick. </p>

            <p>For those more interested in a relaxing staycation, the Grand Sierra Pines hotel is a great option. 
                It’s nestled in a less commercial side of Baguio, offering guests a quiet 
                environment for a truly restful experience. You can choose from a Superior 
                Room, Deluxe Room, or Family Room depending on your preference; but each 
                room is designed thoughtfully to provide both comfort and luxury for its 
                guests.</p>

            <p>In Baguio, travelers are more likely to come across decades-old 
                cabins, so the Orchard Hotel’s minimalist and modern design is 
                a really refreshing choice especially for returning travelers. 
                It has also claimed a millennial approach to their design, 
                making sure every angle of the hotel is Instagram-friendly. </p>
