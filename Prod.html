        <div>
            <a>One of the Philippines’ popular destinations, 
                Baguio holds the title of being the “Summer Capital of the 
                Philippines” and enjoys a cool weather year-round due to 
                high-level elevation of 5,050 ft above sea level. The city 
                of pines is highly dependent on tourism, therefore, 
                attractions are always full. To cater to everyone, a 
                variety of delicacies are sold along the streets of every 
                famous tourist spot. </a>

                Filipinos are known heavy drinkers. In every celebration, 
                anywhere in the Philippines, they never miss a chance in bringing out 
                their treasured alcohol for everyone to share. Clearly, Baguio is no 
                exception. As Baguio is known for strawberries, of course they would 
                have an alcohol that has their pride embossed on it. While it has a 
                slightly lower alcohol content than most wines, don’t underestimate 
                its abilities.
